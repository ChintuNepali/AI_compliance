1. Call to Action (CTA): The ad should clearly tell the user what to do next (e.g., "Call Now", "Shop Today").
2. Unique Selling Proposition (USP): Highlight what makes the product different (e.g., "24/7 Support", "Lowest Price").
3. Use Numbers: Ads perform better with specific numbers or stats (e.g., "500+ happy clients" instead of "Many happy clients").
4. Emotional Hook: Try to address a pain point or a desire (e.g., "Stop wasting money on electric bills").
5. Urgency: If applicable, use words that imply time sensitivity (e.g., "Offer ends soon").
